has been fairly heavily modified for easier use, correction of typos, new options, and logical outcomes.\n\nCongratulations! You are a new contestant on the popular television game show \"Slut Life.\" For the next year, you will be living in an apartment provided by us along with the other contestants. All of your actions will be monitored and broadcasted constantly to a universal audience, along with weekly episodes to recap what you were up to for those who don't want to watch a stream all the time. At the end of the year, you will be rewarded with whatever you've chosen from the provided list. Breaking any rules (without prior permission) will result in punitive action, up to and including the revocation of your reward. Should you break any rules, you may plead your case, but any decisions will be final, with no chance of appeal. \n\nAs part of the show, you will be transported to another planet for the duration of your stay if possible. If it is not possible, you will need to use a heavily modified contract to account for the differences. Instead to the normal 24 hour days you're used to, each day on this planet lasts for 32 hours. It has the same orbital period, though, so it only has 39 weeks in a year. While this may seem tiring at first, your body will adjust rather quickly. After you're done, you can either stay here or go back to Earth, or your planet of origin.\n\nTo begin, select someone from the list below to help you fill out your forms. They each have their own priorities, so you may get different results depending on who you choose. Of course, you could always try to prepare the contract yourself. I'm sure you won't miss anything important doing that. Probably. Good luck.\n\nOnce you've chosen your helper, choose a difficulty from the Difficulty Tab and an Origin Tab, as these affect both your starting balance of credits and change how certain other tabs function. From there, work your way through the other tabs in any order you like. If you're using a spreadsheet (like the example set up in the final tab), you can take entire lines and drop them into the sheet to provide a running total with minimal effort (or just copy the last page into a new spreadsheet and work from there). Most options either cost or reward credits. Dependencies have been simplified as much as possible, but, in general, buying a sub option also requires buying the original option as well. Options that can be purchased multiple times will be marked as such, otherwise they can only be purchased once. No options should be considered mutually exclusive unless otherwise stated (both options should say \"Cannot be taken with [the other option],\" but sometimes things get missed, so if one option says it can't be taken with the other, you can't take both.).\n\nPay attention to any special instructions listed at the top of each tab, as that will explain more about any additional requirements or restriction that affect that tab.\n\nOnce you have made all of your selections, your credit balance must be non-negative (0 or higher) unless otherwise stated, you may not have more roommates than the maximum allowed by your living space, and you cannot have used more than seven Owner slots.", "9": [9], "10": 1}, {"0": "Yourself (No Helper)", "1": 0, "2": "You will prepare all the needed paperwork on your own (This is the best option if you don't want to include a complicated story about how you made the decisions you made).", "4": [-4], "9": [0], "10": 1, "14": [3]}, {"0": "Cindy Matos", "1": 0, "2": "As a former contestant, she knows what she's talking about.
